# 💡 Simpler & Cheaper Alternative: Direct Midjourney

## 🤔 Current Situation
- useapi.net setup is complex and requires specific Discord configurations
- Cost: ~$167-334 for 334 monsters
- Setup time: Could take hours to get working properly

## 🎯 Better Alternative: Direct Midjourney + Semi-Automation

### **Cost Comparison:**
- **useapi.net**: $167-334 + setup complexity
- **Direct Midjourney**: $10-20 total + simpler setup

### **Approach:**
1. **Get Midjourney Basic** ($10/month)
2. **Use Discord directly** with simple automation
3. **Batch process** in relaxed mode (unlimited)

## 🚀 Simple Semi-Automated Approach

### **Step 1: Prepare Prompts**
Create a text file with all your prompts:

```
/imagine Fantasy D&D Goblin, dark fantasy card art style, detailed portrait --ar 1:1
/imagine Fantasy D&D Adult Black Dragon, dark fantasy card art style, detailed portrait --ar 1:1
/imagine Fantasy D&D Aboleth, dark fantasy card art style, detailed portrait --ar 1:1
... (334 total)
```

### **Step 2: Batch Generation Methods**

#### **Method A: Discord Bot (Technical)**
- Use existing Discord bots for Midjourney automation
- Still requires some setup but much simpler than useapi.net
- Free after Midjourney subscription

#### **Method B: Manual with Efficiency (Easiest)**
- Copy/paste prompts into Midjourney Discord
- Use relaxed mode (unlimited generations)
- Generate 20-30 per day over 2 weeks
- Download images manually or with browser automation

#### **Method C: Browser Automation**
- Use tools like Puppeteer to automate Discord interactions
- Simpler than API integration
- More reliable than third-party APIs

## 💰 Cost Analysis
